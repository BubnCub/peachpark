                        <p class="summary">Your first steps into the park proper will be at Peach Plaza. This area hosts a wide range of shops, entertainment venues, and restaurants that provide a taste of what each area has to offer. The plaza is a maze of lush foliage full of places to rest in the shade during your extended stay. At the center of it all is Momo Castle, the delightfully spooky home of the Peach family, overlooking a massive entertainment venue with daily performances of all kinds. Take a load off, have a drink or something to eat, or simply enjoy the show.</p>

This bustling dock is where we see to the arrival of our guests and manage our supply shipments. Don't worry, you won't see the business end of this place, as you will be gleefully guided to the main entrance of the park proper.

Indeed, it's just a short jaunt southwest from the plaza to find Doki bay. A cornucopia of water rides and excitement await, as well as beach side lounging and drink service for the adults. Don't worry parents, our dryad attendants have all the maternal instincts of the allmother herself, and will ensure no harm comes to your little ones. So sit back, have a drink, and enjoy the exquisite view from Doki bay.

                            For a peaceful change of pace, we invite you to take a stroll through Miku's Garden. Nestled in Aura lake at the center of the island, this stunning mini island is the perfect place for a quiet picnic away from the hustle and bustle of the park. Keep your eyes peeled, for you are never alone in the garden. Some say the ghost of a young girl ready for school calls this place home, but do not fear. Miku has only ever wanted a friend. Could you be that friend?

                            If you're in for a thrill, this is the attraction for you. On the eastern side of the central island valley, nestled against the cliff is an abandoned school with a mysterious past. A diabolical labyrinth awaits the moment you enter, as the anatomy of the school grounds, and indeed the school itself, shift subliminally as you make your way through the haunted grounds. Some say a tragedy befell this cursed location, and to find a black rose is to begin to unravel its secrets. Beware, for they also say when you pluck this rose a murderous fiend will haunt your every step. Can you make it out alive?
