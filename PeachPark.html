            <h2 class="subtitle">Momo Island:</h2>
            <h3 class="paragraph">
                In the scarcely traveled region of the ocean, surrounded by storms and sharpened stacks sits the mysterious Momo Island. This island, known for its gargantuan peaches, is the last bastion of magic and myth. Creatures only heard of in legends and table top RPG's call this place home. It is a common site to find Dryads dancing with trolls, gnomes debating over shrubbery placement, and gardens grown in the blink of an eye. If you're lucky, you may even catch a glimpse of Gertrude, the resident dragon. Don't worry, she only wants your Lego sets. The most mysterious and impressive part of this island would be the park that resides within.

            <h2 class="subtitle">Peach Park</h2>
            <h3 class="paragraph">
                Other parks may claim to be the most magical place on earth, but do they have mossy skeletons cleaning the walkways? What about a floating Ferris wheel, or roasted peach slices the size of a pancake? There are many wondrous things to be found at Peach Park, from the gravity defying Star Wheel, to the Pit Chariot, a roller coaster spanning the entirety of the park. While it is certainly a breathtaking site to behold, it isn't without its dangers.

            <h2 class="subtitle">Kodai Noki and the Shattered</h2>
            <h3 class="paragraph">
                Deep in the center of the island, north of the main plaza hides an old abandoned school ground. Very few know of its origin, and those that do refuse to share the tale. What is known is that the area is constantly shifting, like a living maze. From deep within this maze lurks the malevolent tree spirit, the Kodai Noki and its bodyguard kuMi, a masked schoolgirl wielding an axe. It's within this maze that it sets its minions, the Shattered, on the park at large. The Shattered are creatures who have had their souls stolen from them, reshaping their physical forms into shadowy husks filled with an insatiable desire to take from others what was taken from them. Not all is lost, though. Neither the Kodai nor kuMi can leave the maze, and while the Shattered can, They stand no chance against the owner of the park.

            <h2 class="subtitle">The Star of the Show</h2>
            <h3 class="paragraph">
                <p>Every park has a mascot, and Peach Park is no exception. The entire park is owned by, and was built specifically for the mischievous and  big hearted Peach Pit. A sproutling of the Terran Imp species, Peach Pit and her three siblings call the park, and the island itself, home. A wild card to beat wild cards and a master of dysfunction, the young Pit can easily be found wreaking her own adorable brand of havoc around the island. From carpet bombing crowds with flowers, to tossing whoopee cushions on your seat from twenty yards. Did your hot dog go missing? Did you find your freshly refilled drink suddenly empty? Chances are you were visited by the lovable scamp herself.</p>

                <p>She isn't all about fun and games though. At the first sighting of shattered she jumps into action. With the help of her siblings, as well as the witch twins and a stoic shrine maiden, Peach Pit makes quick work of any threat to her home, often with her own brand of chaos. Whether its a Pop Clone potion, a well placed flower bomb, or simply the swing of her trusty mallet, nothing will stop Peach Pit and her family from keeping the park, and you, safe from harm.</p>
            </h3>

            <h2 class="subtitle">Conclusion</h2>
            <h3 class="paragraph">
                <p>With all of this in mind, you can rest assured that your stay at our magnificent park will be filled with fun and excitement the likes of which you have never experienced. Tour any of our themed areas, relax on our scenic beaches, have a romantic evening at lover's cove, or simply take in the daily performances in the main plaza. You can sample fine cuisine from around the world, from extravagant sit down restaurants to finger foods you can eat on the go. If you wish to try your luck, you can play any of our exciting booth games, like the cork shooter Peach Park Pop, whose booths around the park are themed to match each area. There's no end to what you can do, and we assure you that there isn't a safer, more magical place on this great blue ball.</p>
