                        <p class="summary">Mischievous and playful, Peach Pit treats the park like her own personal playground (because it is). She's a precocious little impling with an instinct for pranks and a heart of gold. Due to an incident before her planting that left her seed cracked, Peach Pit was left with a broken voice box. Fortunately, as with the rest of her kind, she was born with a secondary communication organ, her music box. She can mimic any instrument and has no trouble using it to communicate. When she's not terrorizing park residents, she's usually listening to cutesy metal, playing video games, or generally having a doki doki morning. Like any other kid, Peach Pit has a best friend. Unlike other kids, her best friend is a ghost. Specifically the ghost of a young school girl named Miku. They love to run amock together through the park, even if Peach Pit is the only one who can see her. There is no end to her troublesome antics. Is your drink cup suddenly empty? Did your food get replaced with a souvenir you had your eye on? Were you hit with a random water balloon? Chances are Peach Pit was involved.</p>

                    <h3>
                        <p class="summary">
                            Peach Pit's second oldest sister and one of the imp twins, Arbor has the presence and appearance of a sturdy tree, until you actually talk to her. What is commonly mistaken for a stoic and cool presence is actually abject anxiety over any kind of social interaction beyond her circle of friends and family. This anxiety stems from a constant and obsessive worry over her appearance, despite the reputation she shares with her twin brother as the models of the family. What she lacks in self confidence she more than makes up for in pure physical strength. Every attraction, every venue, every building has been painstakenly put together by her own hands. All the effort is done out of her loving and protective devotion to her baby sister. Peach Arbor is a gentle soul, with a soft spot for every kid who enters the park. If you ever see the tall and elegant Arbor struggling to make her way through the park, her brother is never too far behind.

                        <p class="summary">
                            Plump as a peach and as obsessive as he is handsome, few can match the intellect hiding behind this imp's eyes. Fructus is a master inventor and a sevant when it comes to anything technical. From hardware to software, there's nothing he can't design. Many of the park's seemingly futuristic marvels, like the Star Wheel and the Boom Gloves used to control the awe inspiring fireworks performances. Unfortunately his obsessions don't stop with the technical. Everything Fructus does comes with a ritual and deviation is out of the question. This does include regular reminders to his twin sister that they are the "cutest kids in the cave." He knows his twin sister struggles with her appearance, so he never lets her forget how amazing she really is, even if she never listens. Like Arbor, Fructus dotes on and cares for their baby sister, Peach Pit. His inventions have a tendancy to fall into her hands at some point, whether he offers them or not.

                        <p class="summary">
                            Woe be unto the poor soul who so much as gazes upon Peach Pit with ill intent, for big sister Blossom is never far behind her. She is the unofficial matriarch of the Peach family, and the quintissential helicopter parent. Blossom has a bond with her baby sister that transcends even the bond between the twins, to the point that she has had premonitions of Pit's future. This led her to the idea of creating a theme park just for Peach Pit, though she stubbornly refuses to tell anyone why. Blossom has a deep love and appreciation for japanese formal wear, often wearing her signature pink kimono. Her stubborn nature can leave her easily agitated, and though she tries to maintain a stoic demeanor her temper has a tendancy to flair up from time to time. She does share one thing with her sister, and that is the love of the prank. She has even gone so far as to commission a giant, peach shaped music box with a spring loaded replica of Peach Pit as a baby, simply to remind her little sister every day that she'll always be the baby. The poor music box is often greeted with the business end of Pit's hammer, but it's nothing a bit of magical mending can't fix.

                            If the witch twins were a coin, Lyza would definitely be heads. An arch druid in red and black witches garb, with a passion for the plant world, one can hardly blame her for bonding so quickly with the Peach family, but her connection is deeper than that. Not only was her direct intervention that allowed Peach Pit to take root and eventually sprout, but she is special desciple of Uryel the Imp Queen known as a gardener. It is her devine charge to care for Uryel's kin, and she relishes the position. Many of the more magical drinks and concoctions of the island came from her brewing prowess. Pop Clone Potions are her own personal brew, which she regrets every time Peach Pit gets her hands on one. Lyza came to the island from a land beyond with her sister, and shows no love or connection to where they came from. She has one of two modes when it comes to conversation: silence and non stop word vomit. Just ask her about anything related to plant monsters and watch that motormouth go.

                        <p class="summary">
                            Azyl is the tails to Lyza's heads, and a necromancer by inheritance. She was charged with following in their father's footsteps, but the only thing she ever cares about is her twin sister (though Peach Pit is doing a wonderful job being added to that list). Her outfit is exactly like her sister's, but with white instead of red. Her personality is borderline manic, but she does her best to hide her feelings behind both a figurative and literal mask. Her contribution to the park would be the custodial and maintenance services. The custodial team is comprised of filth eating, moss covered skeletons, while maintenance is filled with patchwork zombies and the occasional ghoul. Azyl has a strained relationship with her and her sister's parents, and she refuses to tell her sister anything about their disappearance.

                    <h3>
                        <p class="summary">
                            Mako is the only truly stoic resident on the island, and the one to rally the troops when the need arises. Due to incidents involving her family and her kid sister she learned to be self reliant and function under pressure. Serving as both the grounds keeper and the resident Miko, she weilds generations of anti-evil rituals and magic. Mako takes her role seriously, wearing the traditional garb of a Miko as she makes her rounds around the park. Like the other siblings on the island, Mako holds a special place in her heart for her kid sister, Miku. Miku may be dead, but that doesn't stop Mako from checking in on her ghost from time to time. While she may not be able to see her, she can hear her clear as day. Mako is the last surviving member of the Mori clan, and she takes great care to honor their traditions and maintain their cemetary.

                        <p class="summary">
                            Mako's kid sister and Peach Pit's best friend. For those who can see her (Peach Pit and the audience), she is seen in the seifuku she was wearing when she died. A grave mystery lies at the heart of her death, one with ramifications that effect the island and beyond, but if anyone knows what that mystery is, they're not telling. Miku is a soft spoken girl with a heart as big as her eyes, and though her personality seems to run polar opposite to Peach Pit's, there's no end to the fun and excitement the two share together. Some days she'll tell Pit a story, other days she'll take her to a secret place only she knows. Mako spends most of the year in her grove or by Pit's side, though every October she disappears, only to reappear at midnight on halloween. She loves Peach Pit, deeply and truly, and it's because of this love that she refuses to tell Pit the truth of her death. Like so many on the island, she will protect her friend at all costs, even if that means her own soul.

                            Remember that dragon we mentioned earlier? She's the most adorable purple and pink scaled creature you will ever meet, though her size will leave you wondering if she really is a dragon. A dragon's size is directly tied to the size of their horde, and draconic society has yet to accept the autistic dragon's choice of horde. While other dragons choose gold and riches, Gertrude hordes lego and books. There isn't a kit she can't build or an item she can't replicate. With her size making the outside world a dangerous place, her parents wound up bringing her to Momo island while looking for a safe lair for her. This is when they met the Peach clan, and after being accepted by Peach Pit with open arms, the offered her the small cave behind the waterfall at lover's cove. If you ask nicely and offer her a candied peach, she may just show you her lego replica of the island proper.

                            I mentioned the island wasn't without threats, and I wasn't lying. The shattered are creature's whose souls have been devoured. The process leaves them a goopy, mutated mockery of their old selves. The closest thing a shattered has to a personality is a constant and unending hatred towards those that have what they lost. They will rage endlessly until they are dealt with.

                            For those who have seen Miku, it is disturbingly hard to deny the resemblance between her and kuMi. An almost identical copy of Miku, the main differences lie in the colors of their uniform being flipped, and the blood covered mask hiding everything but her crazed, bloodshot eyes behind a fake smile. kuMi stalks the grounds of the abandoned schoolground with a large, blood stained axe, waiting for any unfortunate soul to enter the maze like area. Fortunately she is only present during the month of October.
